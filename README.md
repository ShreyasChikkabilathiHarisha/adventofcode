## Setup and Instructions to run

1. Install golang 
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `go run main.go` in the directory of the day you want to run 
4. Inside each day, based on what the input is, you may need to change the input file name in the main.go file
5. Inside each day, based on what part you want to run, you may need to change the function call in the main.go file

## Tips

1. `VS code` IDE has a great go extension that will help you with syntax and formatting. For a quick run of the code for 
each day, you can change the relevant input and part on main.go, then press `fn + ^ + f5` to run the code without debug 
and `f5` to run the code in debug mode.
2. I have add the `fmt.Println()` statements in the code, wherever it was useful for me. They are commented to keep the 
output clean, but you can uncomment them to see the output of the code at that point.

## Notes
1. I haven't gone back to optimize or refactor the code after I submited the challenge each day, so it may not be the most
efficient. In fact, I have tried to keep the code as simple as possible, to reflect my thinking at the time of solving.
2. I couln't get to solving most of the challenges on the day they were released.
